# KCM Member List Spring 2022

This simple website is intended to help with KCM officer nominations for the Spring 2022 semester. 

Only members may nominate, and only non-senior members may be nominated. This website's dropdown menu allows for KCM attendees to make sure they are a member if they want to vote, and check if their nominations are valid.

It displays the officer descriptions to remind members what to look for in their officer nominations.


## How this website was built

I've been meaning to mess around with React.js so this was a great opportunity to move components and code around and see how it works. I used Cloudflare to make the page public (http://kcm-member-list-spring2022.pages.dev/)!

## In-progress

It would be nice if I could figure out how to (or if I can) make the page public through Github, not Cloudflare, but it works! We ended up making a QR code of the website for use during the nomination meeting, and members who wanted to reference the member list and officer descriptions from their phone scanned it and had it in from of them to see :)
