# KCM Member List Spring 2022

This simple website is intended to help with KCM officer nominations for the Spring 2022 semester. 

Only members may nominate, and only non-senior members may be nominated. This website's dropdown menu allows for KCM attendees to make sure they are a member if they want to vote, and check if their nominations are valid.

It also (will) displays the officer descriptions to remind members what to look for in their officer nominations.


## How this website was built

I've been meaning to mess around with React.js so this was a great opportunity to move components and code around and see how it works.

## In-progress

 Still trying to figure out how to make the App.js file visible when the Github page is opened, instead of the README file.
